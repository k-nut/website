# Hi, I'm Knut ðŸ‘‹
I'm a developer from Berlin working on various web- and open data related things.

## Some Projects
<ul class="projects-list">
  <li> <a href="https://unisport.berlin"> unisport.berlin</a> <br />
      Search through all the sports classes that Berlin's universities offer </li>
  <li> <a href="https://license-check.k-nut.eu">GitHub License Check</a> <br />
      Check if all of you remembered to add a license to all your GitHub repositories</li>
  <li> <a href="https://jedeschule.de/schulen/">jedeschule.de</a> <br />
   <span>
  Freelance support for the <a href="https://okfn.de">Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland</a>. We scraped the schools from all states in Germany and made them searchable in a single website
  </span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
I am part of the <a href="https://codefor.de/berlin">OK Lab Berlin</a> where we meet once a week to work on open data related topics. You should totally <a href="http://www.meetup.com/OK-Lab-Berlin/">join</a>!
</p>

<p>
I started writing down some of the things that I work on or am fascinated by in my <a href="https://blog.k-nut.eu">Blog</a>.
</p>

<p>
I like sharing things I have learned with other people and have given a couple of talks throughout the years. You can find an overview <a href="/speaking/">here</a>.

I graduated from <a href="https://www.htw-berlin.de/">htw Berlin</a> where I studied environmental computer sciences and wrote my <a href="./static/Bachelor-Thesis-Knut-HÃ¼hne.pdf">German Bachelor Thesis</a> about weather adjustment for Energy Metering and Monitoring Systems.
